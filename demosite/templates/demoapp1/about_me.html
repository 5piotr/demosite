    <p class="lead">
      I'm a mechanical engineer with 10 years of professional experience.
      Recently I got interested in programming, to be more precise in machine learning.
      I think this is a very interesting hobby and a valuable addition to my skill set.
      If you want to contact me, please use LinkedIn.
